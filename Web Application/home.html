				And all the plastic waste collected and send to those who reuse the plastics for some other products like Roads, Costumes

                    Usage in plastic is increased day by day and it has became something important in the part of human life. Many products are developed using
                    plastic and they affect our nature. But plastic roads is a useful method in the field of transportation. And mainly only the Non-recycleable plastics are
                    used in this process. Plastic roads are made entirely of plastic or of composites of plastic with other materials. Plastic roads are different
                    from standard roads in the respect that standard roads are made from asphalt concrete, which consists of mineral aggregates and asphalt.
                    The implementation of plastics in roads also opens a new option for recycling post consumer plastics. Australia, Indonesia, India, the United Kingdom,
                    the United States, and many other countries have used technology which can incorporate plastic waste into an asphalt mix.

                <p>Polycycle transform approx 5.5 million PET bottles every day into recycled polyester staple fibre.
                    With a large production capacity of 100 tons, we manufacture semi-dull, optic white and 50 other different dope dyed coloured fibres. In this specific
                    process, we ensure that not a single drop of water is being used for dyeing/colouring of these dope dyed fibres. Polycycle foresee the potential future
                    of the textile industry and the world of sustainable, recycled/renewable products, which is why we are working towards doubling our current production
                    capacity from 100 tons to 200 tons of RPSF every day. In doing so, we will be scavenging and recycling 4.2 billion PET bottles every year.
                    All our innovative projects are supported by renewable sources (solar and wind) and 100% power consumption is entirely renewable. Our modern facilities
                    are certified by Oekotex, GRS, GOTS, OS, FLO CERT and BCI We are Reel cotton member as well.
